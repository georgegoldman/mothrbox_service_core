# 🧠 Mothrbox

**Mothrbox** is a decentralized secret infrastructure engine built on Walrus, a distributed storage pool.
It powers modern applications with encrypted, token-aware data access — secure, blazing-fast, and developer-friendly..

> Encrypt and store anything — models, documents, blobs, metadata — and retrieve them securely using powerful ECC encryption and a privacy-first design.
> Mothrbox handles the heavy lifting of secure storage, while you control access, tokens, and sharing.

## 🔑 What Can Mothrbox Do?

- ✅ Client-side ECC encryption (NIST P-256) for bulletproof security
- ✅ Token-gated and role-based access using NFT-backed credentials
- ✅ Decentralized storage access via Walrus
- ✅ Confidentiality-first infrastructure engine
- ✅ Secure SDKs & APIs for fast developer integration
- ✅ Simple API key-based auth or token delegation 

---

## 🧱 Built on Walrus
Mothrbox is an engine that sits on top of Walrus, a decentralized storage pool, and provides:
- 🧰 Developer tooling to read/write to Walrus effortlessly
- 🛡 Security infrastructure to encrypt and control access to sensitive data
- 🧾 NFT-powered token system to control data sharing, access, or transfer

## ⚙️ Storage Modes

| Mode               | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| 🔐 Encrypted Mode   | Encrypt and store data; decrypt only with the intended private key — perfect for sensitive or gated content. |
| 📂 Plain Mode       | Store unencrypted data for public access or fast retrieval — ideal for open data, media, or metadata. |
| 🔷 Token-Gated Mode | Access or unlock content only if the caller holds a valid NFT-based access token. |

You choose. We handle the hard parts.

## 🧪 Example Use Cases

- 🧠 Store and gate AI model files or embeddings
- 🧾 Share encrypted documents with revocable access
- 🔐 Role-gated or NFT-gated content experiences
- 🧬 Store sensitive personal, medical, or legal data privately
- 🌉 Bridge Web2 and Web3 by tokenizing access to off-chain files

---

## 🧬 Token Experience
Mothrbox supports a decentralized, NFT-powered access model:

- 🎟 Mint access tokens as NFTs — each token grants permission to use the Mothrbox service (e.g., API access, storage rights)
- 🔐 Token holders can interact with Mothrbox's encryption and storage engine
- 🔁 Transfer NFTs to other users to delegate or share access
- ⛔️ Revoke or expire access dynamically based on token state

> This enables a new paradigm: tokenized infrastructure access, where service usage is decentralized and user-owned.
